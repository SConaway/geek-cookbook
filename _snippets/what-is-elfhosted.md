!!! question "What is ElfHosted? :elf:"

    ElfHosted is "self-hosting as a service" (*SHAAS?* ) - Using our [Kubernetes](/kubernetes/) / [GitOps](kubernetes/deployment/flux/design/) designs, we've build infrastructure and automation to run popular self-hosted apps (*think "Plex, Radarr, Mattermost.."*) and attach your own cloud storage ("bring-your-own-storage").

    We're building "in public", so follow the progress on the [blog](/blog/tags/#elfhosted) or in [Discord][elfhosted/discord]). You'll get $10 free credit when you [sign up](https://elfhosted.com), so you can play around without commitment!

    TL;DR? Here's a guide to [getting started](https://elfhosted.com/how-to/get-started/), and another to [migrating](https://elfhosted.com/how-to/migrate/) from another provider.
